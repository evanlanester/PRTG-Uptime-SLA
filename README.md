# PRTG Uptime SLA
PRTG doesn't support any kind of System Uptime Sensors, so I wrote the following 3 scripts to provide the Daily Sensor Uptime Average of all sensors, the Weekly Average and the Overall Average.


## Quick Overview of the Scripts Available 
| Versions        | Description | Scanning Internval |
|-----------------|:-----------:|:-------------------|
| [PRTG_SLA_Overall.ps1]() | Averages the uptime since the creation for each Sensor |  |
| [PRTG_SLA_Daily.ps1]() | Averages the uptime of the last 24 Hours for each Sensor |  |
| [PRTG_SLA_Weekly.ps1]() | Averages the uptime of the last 7 Days for each Sensor |  |
